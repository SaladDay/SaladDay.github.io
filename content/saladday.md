*A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it's not open.*

I define myself as a Web developer & Network engineer(~~although not yet officially~~). I have a strong interest in the Internet and have created some interesting projects. I also enjoy staying updated with the latest trends and researching 'useless' things.
